          <p><span class="first-character atw">I</span>n 2016, 47000 seniors lived <bold>alone.</bold> By 2030, 83000 elderly will live <bold>alone.</bold> In 2019 a voice mentioned neighbours are important. But yet, how many people actually do we go out and speak to? No system has been established.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p>Then, in 2020, Singapore experienced the serious COVID-19 pandemic. Due to circuit breaking measures and prevent further spread of the virus, Singaporeans were told not to visit their grandparents. Old age homes were also closed due to a big cluster, to advocate prevention for a further spread of the virus.</p>

        <p class="margin-top-10">Circuit breaking measures have since been released. However, no one can predict what will happen next. We never want such lonely situations to happen again. So, we need to prevent this. And thus, Lim Kopi, a system for seniors, or anyone really, to talk share and learn together, was born.</p>

        <h2>2. Idea</h2>

    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="first-character atw">L</span>im Kopi will be a system, suitable for elders, or any adult really. It's more of an open course / sharing programme, grouped based on physical locations, based on WhatsApp. We will split users up into group chats based on physical locations (North, West and East to start of with and expanding), then have volunteers in each group chat to facilitate courses and conversations. Once people are used to each other, they can start hosting meetings on their own, sharing their skills and experiences, etc. It's a rather open concept, just that we get as many people up to join the conversation.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">These are details of how it will work. We spread the message out; seniors who might just want to find someone to have a conversation can just simply message our Lim Kopi Admin. Following that, the contact will be passed to volunteers (who have been vetted), and then after having a simple video/voice call over WhatsApp for introduction and security purposes, he/she will be able to join the group chat.<br><br>In the group chat, volunteers will host own meetings and activities. These can be online or offline. They can do what they are good at, e.g. art, cooking, exercises, introduction to technology etc. Seniors themselves can also share what they enjoy doing. The main point of this is to allow both seniors and volunteers to come together in an open environment, so everyone is cared for through cultivating a kampung spirit.<br><br>Here's how our system sets us apart from typical old age homes, and why it works:</p>
          <ul><li>It's free.</li><li>It just happens at home virtually, or in near areas in a physical community. <br>(Users are tagged location-based).</li><li>Anyone can learn from each other, with emotional support.</li><li>It cultivates a community spirit, so in case anything happens in future, <br>we have someone to rely on/talk to.</li><li>It is simple to use. Simply WhatsApp, which many seniors should know.</li><li>Our system is safe with vetting put into place.</li><li>We are constantly expanding to cultivate more like-minded conversations and activities.</li><li>There is literally NO online system like this, although it is rather simple to do honestly.</li><li>There will be so many people to talk to, if everyone joins the database. Surely not a dull conversation.</li><li>Learn from the comfort of your home, but still with accompaniment.</li></ul>
          <p class="margin-top-10">Thus, we have everyone in the community learning together and from each other.</p>
          <p class="margin-top-10">Our system is launching on <bold>August 1</bold>. Before that ,we just want to call out for volunteers, seniors, anyone at all to join and participate. We'll collate a list. On <bold>August 1</bold>, we'll start off with a range of activities and conversations. Simple as that. We want to get everybody on board and make sure they won't miss anything. So we're launching, on 2020, <bold>August 1.</bold></p>

        <h2>3. How you can help</h2>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="block">
          <p>I see you look at our social pages, and say, why would I support a page with nobody supporting? That's because we're new. If nobody supports, where will we get people to learn onboard this system? It's a simple system, but requires people. And that's where we need you.</p><br><br>
        <p><span class="first-character atw">W</span>e need help. No media has spread about such systems happening. People think it's complicated, when it's actually so simple, how Lim Kopi can connect people with each other.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
          <p class="margin-top-10">WE NEED YOU TO SHARE. Get this on board. Seniors, if you are looking at this now, <br><br><bold><a class="middlea" href="https://wa.me/6587389133">click here to our whatsapp</a><br> to join in on the fun and conversations online.</bold> We'll direct you simply to a WhatsApp group, but having activities and conversations that you can have for free. Get to know people! Cook together, exercise together, read together, explore together, no matter offline or online.</p>
          <p class="margin-top-10">Get back the strong community spirit we had in the past. Where's it gone? Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, come on. Find us at</p><ul><li><a class="middle" href="https://www.facebook.com/Lim-Kopi-Community-106732751090694">Facebook: Lim Kopi Community Page</a></li><li>
          <a class="middle">Instagram: Currently not available. Use hashtag #limkopisg</a></li></ul><p>Yes. Share. So more and more people know our existence and provision of activities, and the community of conversations going on.</p>
          <p class="margin-top-10"><bold>Honestly, not just seniors.</bold> Learning is for anyone. Though many seniors are alone, and of course it's so much better that they get the fun in life everyone should be getting, <bold> everyone should be learning. </bold>Even you. Join in the skills sessions, the valuable conversations that you can never have anywhere else. Same WhatsApp link. We'll direct you. Just come on board!</p>

          <p class="margin-top-10">WE NEED YOU TO SHARE. Get this on board. Finally, we're looking out for volunteers to vet people. Same WhatsApp link. Any queries, email works too. Either way, share, join, help. We're here as a Singapore community and this shouldn't stop at NDP.</p>

        <h2>4. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>his concept seems seriously, untrustable. So we're here to answer some of your questions. These include who the founder of the Lim Kopi community is, how we will get people on board, how secure the platform is, how technology will work and so on.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <button class="accordion">Who are you?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Behind the scenes of Lim Kopi, I am just a student. Honestly, inspiration came because I saw how easy it can be, to support a community. Yet, no one has done so. I wish to take this forward, as far as I can, and establish the Kampung spirit that holds us Singaporeans united. In case any pandemic resurfaces, we can then stand firmly together. And even if none of these happen in the future, we have a free-styled community where volunteers gear up and do whatever they want, and if each person does his/her part in the community, then nobody will be left alone again.<br><br>For more about myself, honestly, I don't really want to give out too much information. I am a student who loves designing and developing for good purposes, and in the future might consider starting a business.<br><br>How am I trustable, you ask? I put in so much effort to design and create this website, to design posts on Facebook and Instagram...if you still don't trust me, honestly...</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Short term plans?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>We'll be starting off by recruiting volunteers around Singapore, then virtually have 5 group chats: for all participants/volunteers, for all volunteers, for people in the East, North, and finally West. That's why we need your help to spread the message. Because if we don't source out enough people, who honestly just want someone to speak to, who want someone to cook, or exercise, or read with, the system won't hold up. We won't have enough people with the same interests. So we need sufficient people, probably hoping for around just double-digit numbers in each group chat, then expanding.<br><br>But again, as I keep repeating, the hard thing is we need to get the message across to people who want to join this system. Many may not know this exists. So please, just keep the messages coming to the WhatsApp/Email, and we would love to have your help.</p>
    </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are you launching only on 1 August?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I've tried such a thing before. If you don't have enough users, and our dear seniors see the lack of users in the group chat, they might leave. If we gather enough people, and maybe even too many, surely they'll find something that interests them, and stay on the platform. It's all a matter of how we get people on board.</p>
    </div>
      
    <button class="accordion">Long term plans?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>More group chats. Probably one for each sub-area, like planning districts. Especially in HDBs, you have a lot of people who actually are longing to look for things to do together with someone else, just that you don't know it. It's not hard to maintain a system of such on WhatsApp. If further development happens, we might create an app or partner with various app organizations, to create a shared gaming system for common games online.</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Will this, that or that help?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Sharing on Facebook? Yes. Instagram? Yes. WhatsApp family/school group chats? Yes. WE NEED ALL HELP WE CAN GET. Trust yourself and whatever you do, will support our Lim Kopi Community.<br><br>Also, we are looking out for volunteers so identify yourself and tell us how you would like to help, on WhatsApp/Email.</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">What sets your system apart from others?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Our system is the simplest you can get, based on technology. If seniors want to use "elderly friendly apps", they surely know how to use WhatsApp. In fact, so many people know how to use WhatsApp. We can leverage on other platforms such as Zoom, or just some online chess system or games as we go along. Resources are out there, it's just how we make use of it.<br><br>Also, our cost is almost zero. We just need volunteers to do whatever they like. They are happy, seniors are happy, we are happy.</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Elaborate on security?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption, and people (probably including you) use it everyday so we won't worry about hackers/scammers/spammers etc. We will also make use of a user-vetting system. When seniors first contact us, they contact our main admin channel, which is the number you see below. I will then source out the vetting to other volunteers, or do it myself. Vetting process includes video calls, text messages, just to verify the other side is a trustable person. After that, we'll just add them into the list/group, where they can enjoy their time after an introduction. Simple as that.<br><br>Other programs we may use will also be checked for security, and will be well-known at least. For example, we will check that a certain system is safe before using it.</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Volunteers?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>WhatsApp or email, identify yourself, video call, check on your profile, welcome in. Please come in as we just need volunteers to help out with "buddying up with seniors", hosting programmes, etc.</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Who can join in on the system?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Literaly anyone. Our target is people above 40, but honestly, one thing I'd like to make clear right here, right now is that we want this system to be a proactive one. People want to join to learn courses and skills. Cook together, have fun together etc., there is literally no limit. Seniors who are also proficient in technology are also welcome to become volunteers. It's how we come together as a community in Singapore.</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">What are examples of activities?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The Lim Kopi WhatsApp system is more of self-directed. We have volunteers who can do what they are good at, for example cooking at home, virtually. If seniors want they could just have a chat whenever one wants to. They can share information, tips, content. Basically a virtual support server, but safe and moderated.<br><br>Examples may include cooking, yoga, art, languages learning, technology learning, gardening, calligraphy, music, you name it, you want it, just host it.</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">You mentioned a physical link with virtual. Can you elaborate?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The whole system was originally built on the basis of having physical meetings over Kopi. We see seniors downstairs HDBs, playing chess, just walking around aimlessly, etc. But due to COVID-19, this can't happen. And it makes us realize the impact of how they have a hard time without technology. So we hope to take this opportunity to build on their technological skills, make their life easier through activities, and at the same time, also host physical meetings (such as competiitons, classes etc.) so they have a "virtual-physical" balance. (TLDR, we'll be swapping between online meetings/courses and offline meetings/courses).</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Are you looking out for collaborations with organizations?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>YES. YES. YES. PLEASE. Specifically, we just need you to spread out the message. But surely if you have any other ideas look for us by emailing or WhatsApp. If your organization involves checking on people physically, we also hope to partner with you to bring the system online, so we can have both physical and virtual checks to ensure everybody is good, and enjoying life. (with kopi).</p>
    </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Funds?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Currently no. However, we are looking out for opportunities to expand once we have a rich database of people, and include more game features into our meetings/acitvities, so only then will we need funding.</p>
    </div>

    <section class="block">
      <div>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Do email us here if you have any questions.<br><br>TLDR, we currently need people to spread the message, so as many people can get onboard the system. You don't have to be a senior, honestly. In fact, we just want people who want someone to talk to, or want to do something, share talents in a community. Here's the place for it.</p>
